# Project 1 - Packet Filter Firewall
In this lab, we explore the workings of a packet filter firewall by setting up an environment with two Linux virtual machines. One machine functions as a dual-homed Gateway client, accessing external networks through one interface, while the other serves as a Client that can only access external networks via the gateway. The gateway is configured with the Linux iptables firewall and enables NAT for selected protocols. Additionally, a web server is set up on the Gateway with a test web page. We will demonstrate full control over network traffic by allowing only specific protocols for specific destinations through modifications to the firewall script.
# Project 2 - SDN-Based Stateless Firewall
This lab focuses on setting up a software-defined environment using Mininet and Containernet. We practice configuring an OpenFlow-based flow-level firewall on SDN and develop and implement flow-based firewall filtering policies. These policies include accepting, dropping, or rejecting incoming flows to ensure the system's safety from malicious network traffic.
# Project 3 - SDN-Based DoS Attacks and Mitigation
n this lab, I simulate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in an SDN networking environment. DDoS attacks can target various components within the SDN infrastructure. I set up an SDN-based firewall environment using Containernet, POX controller, and Open Virtual Switch (OVS). To mitigate DoS attacks, I develop a "port security" solution. The lab involves implementing firewall filtering rules to enforce required security policies, accompanied by screenshots and illustrations demonstrating how the firewall's packet filtering requirements are met.
# Project 4 - Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection Solutions
In this lab, I utilize the NSL-KDD dataset, a refined version of the KDDâ€™99 dataset, to conduct two labs focusing on data preprocessing, training, and testing using Anaconda, TensorFlow, and FNN. The NSL-KDD dataset is widely used for network traffic and attack analysis and serves as a benchmark for modern internet traffic.
